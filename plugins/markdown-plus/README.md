# markdown+

A plugin for parsing Markdown text and rendering it using JsonML. This allows us
to take advantage of widgets and macros within Markdown text. It's based on an
unholy marriage of TiddlyWiki's
[Markdown](https://tiddlywiki.com/plugins/tiddlywiki/markdown) plugin, Khan
Academy's [simple-markdown](https://github.com/Khan/simple-markdown) library and
the default WikiText parser bundled with TiddlyWiki.

Syntax is broadly compatible with [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org) (save
corner cases), and includes several helpful extensions. Specifics are detailed
in [usage]($:/plugins/noahlange/markdown-plus/usage)."
